<p>
    During {{ EFFORT_DURATION_STR }}, you must <span class="fw-bold">count the "1"s in grids of
        {{ GRID_SIZE.0 }} rows and {{ GRID_SIZE.1 }} columns composed only of "0"s and "1"s</span>.
    A total of {{ NUM_GRIDS }} grids will be available to you.
</p>
<p>
    You must first select a grid by clicking on one of the {{ NUM_GRIDS }} available buttons.
    Once the grid is displayed, count the number of "1"s it contains, enter your answer in the input box,
    then click <i>Validate</i>. The button of the solved grid then turns orange to indicate that you have
    already counted it. Click another button to select a new grid and repeat the process.
</p>

{{ if subsession.treatment == INDIVIDUAL }}
<p>
    Your earnings depend solely on your own performance and not on the performance of the other
    group members. For each correctly counted grid, you will receive {{ PIECE_RATE }} ECU.
</p>

{{ elif subsession.treatment == COOPERATION }}
<p>
    Your earnings in this task will depend on the best score in the group.
    The best score is the one achieved by the group member who has correctly counted the number of "1"s
    in the largest number of grids.
    For each grid correctly counted by the best group member, each group member will receive
    {{ PIECE_RATE }} ECU. Thus, the better your teammates perform, the higher your earnings will be.
</p>

{{ endif }}

<p>
    You can complete as many grids as you wish during the {{ EFFORT_DURATION_STR }} allocated to you. <br>
    <span class="fst-italic">You will be informed of your earnings for this task at the end of the experiment.</span>
