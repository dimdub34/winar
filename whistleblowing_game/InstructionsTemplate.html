<p class="fw-bold">The composition of the groups is identical to Part 1. </p>
<p>
    At the beginning of this part, the computer program will randomly select one group among those
    present in the room. This group will be referred to as the <b><i>Passive</i></b> group. The other groups will
    be referred to as the <b><i>Active</i></b> groups.
</p>
<p class="fst-italic">
    The final gains of the members of the Passive group will depend on their Part 1 gains as well as the
    decisions made by the members of the Active groups in Part 2.
</p>
<p>
    Since the members of the Passive group will not make any decisions in this part, the instructions
    below concern only the members of the Active groups. <br>
    Once all participants have read these instructions, you will be informed whether you are in the Passive
    group or in an Active group.
</p>

<h5>Roles and decisions in the Active groups</h5>
<p>
    In each Active group, the computer program randomly assigns a role to each of the {{ PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}
    players.
    <span class="fw-bold">There will be one Red Player and two Blue Players.</span>
</p>
<p>
        <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">The Red Player can increase his/her earnings by “stealing” ECU
        from the Passive group.</span> Concretely, the Red Player must make a binary decision: to steal or
    not to steal ECU from the Passive group.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the Red Player decides to steal ECU, he/she gains {{ STEALING_AMOUNT }} ECU, while the Passive group
        loses {{ STEALING_LOSS }} ECU in total: each member of the Passive group loses
        {{ STEALING_LOSS_INDIV }} ECU (<i>{{ STEALING_LOSS_INDIV }} ECU × {{ PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} =
        {{ STEALING_LOSS }} ECU</i>).
    </li>
    <li>
        If the Red Player decides not to steal ECU from the Passive group, all participants’ earnings remain
        unchanged compared to those of Part 1.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
        <span class="fw-bold">A Red Player who decides to steal ECU from the Passive group is liable to incur
            a penalty of {{ STEALING_PENALTY }} ECU if reported by a Blue Player.</span>
</p>

<h5>Reporting rules</h5>
<p>
    In each Active group, the two Blue Players must decide whether or not to report the Red Player of their group
    if he/she has stolen ECU from the Passive group. Reporting is anonymous.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="fw-bold">If a Blue Player reports the Red Player and the Red Player has stolen:</span><br>
        The Red Player has a probability of {{ AUDIT_PROBABILITY_STR }} of being penalized, and a probability of
        {{ NON_AUDIT_PROBABILITY_STR }} of not being penalized.
        {{ if subsession.reward }}
        <ul>
            <li>If the Red Player is penalized, the Blue Player pays a reporting cost of {{ REPORTING_COST }} ECU and
                receives a reward of {{ REPORTING_REWARD }} ECU.
            </li>
            <li>If the Red Player is not penalized, the Blue Player pays no cost and receives no reward.</li>
        </ul>
        {{ else }}
        <ul>
            <li>If the Red Player is penalized, the Blue Player pays a reporting cost of {{ REPORTING_COST }} ECU.
            </li>
            <li>If the Red Player is not penalized, the Blue Player pays no cost.</li>
        </ul>
        {{ endif }}
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fw-bold">If a Blue Player reports the Red Player but the Red Player did not steal:</span><br>
        {{ if subsession.reward }}
        The Red Player incurs no penalty and the Blue Player incurs no reporting cost (and receives no reward).
        {{ else }}
        The Red Player incurs no penalty and the Blue Player incurs no reporting cost.
        {{ endif }}
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Randomized reporting</h5>
<p>
    Once both Blue Players have made their decisions, <span class="fw-bold">the computer randomly selects one of
        the two Blue Players’ decisions (to report or not).</span>
    If the selected decision is to report, the Red Player is reported; otherwise, nothing happens.
