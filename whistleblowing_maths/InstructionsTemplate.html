<p>
    During {{ EFFORT_DURATION_STR }}, <span class="fw-bold">you will have to calculate sums of numbers.</span>
    A total of {{ NUM_OPERATIONS }} operations will be available to you.
    Each operation contains numbers whose sum you need to calculate.
</p>
<p>
    You must first select an operation by clicking on one of the {{ NUM_OPERATIONS }} available buttons.
    Once the operation is displayed, calculate the sum of the numbers, enter your answer in the input box,
    then click <i>Validate</i>. The button of the corresponding operation then turns orange to indicate
    that you have already calculated it. Click another button to select a new operation and repeat the process.
</p>
{{ if subsession.treatment == INDIVIDUAL }}
<p>
    Your earnings depend solely on your own performance and not on the performance of the other
    group members. For each operation correctly calculated, you will receive {{ PIECE_RATE }} ECU.
</p>
{{ elif subsession.treatment == COOPERATION }}
<p>
    Your earnings in this task will depend on the best score in the group. The best score in the group
    is the one achieved by the member of your group who has correctly calculated the largest number of operations.
    For each operation correctly calculated by the best group member, each group member will receive
    {{ PIECE_RATE }} ECU. Thus, the better your teammates perform in this task, the higher your earnings will be.
</p>
{{ endif }}
<p>
    You can complete as many operations as you wish during the {{ EFFORT_DURATION_STR }} allocated to you. <br>
    <span class="fst-italic">You will be informed of your earnings for this task at the end of the experiment.</span>
