In the first question, we asked your opinion on the facts explaining climate change.

You will now participate in an auction to decide whether or not your opinion will be given to future participants in our experiment.

To participate in the auction, you will receive €1.00 that you can use to make a bid. You can bid any amount up to this amount and will get to keep the rest.

In the auction, you will be matched with the other participants in your same session.

The opinion from the participant that bids the most in the auction will be given to 30 future students like you participating in this study.

The future participants will know that the opinion came from the past participant that bid the most for their advice to be used.

How much would you like to bid in the auction to have the advice you gave above be used in our future study (maximum €1.00)? Recall that if your bid is successful, your advice will be given to 30 future participants.
