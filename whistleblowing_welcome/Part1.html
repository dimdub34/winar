            In Part 1, the computer program will create groups of {{ PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} at random.
            You will not be able to identify the other members of your group and they will not be able to identify
            you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each group member will complete 3 tasks. At the end of the part, one of the 3 tasks will be randomly
            selected by the computer program, and your gain for Part 1 will be equal to your gain in that task.
            You will be informed of the selected task and of your gain in this task only at the very end of the
            experiment.
