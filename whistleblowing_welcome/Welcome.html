            You are invited to take part in a research study about individual and group decision-making.
            Your participation will help us better understand how people interact with group members and authorities in
            various situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your participation is entirely voluntary. <strong>If you agree to participate, you will receive a fixed fee
            of
            {{ session.config.participation_fee }}, as well as a bonus depending on your decisions and
            those of the other participants.</strong>
            The experiment will last approximately one hour.
        </p>
