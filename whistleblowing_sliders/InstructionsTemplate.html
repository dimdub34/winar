    During {{ EFFORT_DURATION_STR }} <span class="fw-bold">you will have to position sliders on a given target value</span>.
    A total of {{ NUM_SLIDERS }} targets will be available to you.
</p>
<p>
    You must first select a target value by clicking on one of the {{ NUM_SLIDERS }} available buttons.
    Once the target is displayed, move the slider to the given target and then click <i>Validate</i>.
    The button of the corresponding target then turns orange to indicate that you have already positioned it.
    Then choose another target and repeat the process.

{{ if subsession.treatment == INDIVIDUAL }}
<p>
    Your earnings depend solely on your own performance and not on the performance of the other
    group members. For each correctly positioned slider, you will receive {{ PIECE_RATE }} ECU.
</p>
{{ elif subsession.treatment == COOPERATION }}
<p>
    Your earnings will depend on the best score in the group. The best score in the group is
    the one achieved by the member of your group who has correctly positioned the largest number of sliders.
    For each slider correctly positioned by the best group member, each group member will receive
    {{ PIECE_RATE }} ECU. Thus, the better your teammates perform in this task, the higher your earnings will be.

    You can position as many sliders as you wish during the {{ EFFORT_DURATION_STR }} allocated to you. <br>
